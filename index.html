	<h1> Social Distancing Check </h1>
	<p>The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) urges restaurants to maintain a distance of at least six feet between diners while they eat and require face coverings before and after patrons are served as well as requiring face coverings for all waiting staff and kitchen staff.</p>
	<p>Below you can check to see if you can fit all of your tables in your dining room and calculate how many patrons you can seat at once based off of how many tables you have and how many seats are available at each table. Calculations are also based of a dining room area of 1,000 square feet and tables that are 4 feet by 4 feet. </p>
